# DeepComplex
Deep learning prediction of inter-chain contacts of protein complexes

This software has two tools:

(1) Inter-chain Contact Predictor which is used to predict the inter-chain contact map (currently for homodimeric proteins only), and

(2) Complex Structure Reconstructor which is used to construct the final structure of the protein complex from the inter-chain contacts.

##                  Inter Chain Contact Predictor                 

Current version of the inter chain contact predictor can predict the homodimer of upto 500 sequence length

### Usage
For performing a inter-chain contact prediction, run the contact_predictor with the following command:

```
#Usage
python contact_predictor.py <input_fasta> <input_feature_file> <output_directory>

#Example:
python contact_predictor_homodimer.py ./examples/expected_input_file/11AS.fasta ./examples/expected_input_file/feat-11AS.txt /home/rajroy/output/ 11AS
 
```
The program will provide 2 files one is in rr format and another in matrix format of LxL , where L is the length of fasta sequence.
### Testing the inter-chain contact prediction
The program can be tested using the following script:
```
(1) cd /inter_chain_contact_predictor/homo_dimer/examples
(2) sh example.sh


Output examples:
/examples/predict_map_test/predicted_output_file//feat-1A0F_predicted.rr
/examples/predict_map_test/predicted_output_file//feat-1A0F_predicted.rr_matrix.txt
```





##                 Complex_Structure_Reconstructor             

### Setup

Edit the config file at /complex_sturcture_reconstructor/config.py
```
Change the directory of the varaible 'CNS_DIRECTORY' to the directory where it is installed

e.g CNS_DIRECTORY = '/home/rajroy/cns/cns_solve_1.3/'

```

###                        Usage

For performing a complex structure prediction, run structure predictor with the following command:
```
#Usage
python structure_predictor_n-mer.py <target_id> <pdb_list_file> <restrain_list_file> <output_file>

#Example
python structure_predictor_n-mer.py test /home/rajroy/multi-mer_test_1/pdb.txt /home/rajroy/multi-mer_test_1/res.txt /home/rajroy/test/

```

#### Instruction
The chain name should be separated by an underscore and should be at the last char of the base name
```
e.g: /home/rajroy/multi-mer_test/provided_files/4OJ5_ABC_X_1.pdb  , here "1" is the name of the chain
```
The interacting chain name should be separated by an underscore and should be at the last 2 char of the base name
```
e.g /home/rajroy/multi-mer_test/provided_files/4OJ5_ABC_AB.rr, here this file would be restains between chain "A and B" respectively
```
